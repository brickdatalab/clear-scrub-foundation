## Important Notes:

⚠️ **Email Verification:** Currently disabled. Users can sign up and immediately sign in. To enable:
1. Go to Supabase Dashboard → Authentication → Settings
2. Toggle "Enable email confirmations"
3. Configure email templates

⚠️ **Subdomain:** Currently dashboard is at /dashboard on main domain. 
To set up dashboard.clearscrub.io subdomain, we'll need to:
1. Configure DNS
2. Deploy separate instance or configure routing
3. Update Supabase redirect URLs

⚠️ **Production Checklist:**
- [ ] Set up custom email provider (Supabase → Settings → Auth)
- [ ] Configure rate limiting
- [ ] Add analytics
- [ ] Set up error monitoring
- [ ] Add privacy policy content
- [ ] Add terms of service content
- [ ] Test all forms end-to-end
